slice of life house

This scene is an example of a different iteration of my current bedroom situation. I mainly included objects that I found from the Unity Asset store. My main character is a cat, which was inspired by the professor's tiger character. Overall I was playing with how my room could look with different types of furniture, different walls and patterns, etc. I was enjoying the process of designing a room, and so I included a decent amount of furniture and decorative pieces.
